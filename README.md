In this project, I developed an IMDB Clone Master website using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend to simulate the features of the popular IMDB platform. The goal was to create a user-friendly movie and TV show database where users can browse content, get detailed information, and rate movies. Below is a breakdown of the core components:

Frontend (ReactJS)
The frontend is built using ReactJS, leveraging its component-based architecture to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Key features include:

Home Page: Displays popular movies and TV shows with interactive elements such as carousels and search filters.
Movie/TV Show Details Page: Provides detailed information about each movie or TV show, including cast, synopsis, ratings, and more.
Search Functionality: Users can search for their favorite movies and TV shows using an intuitive search bar that queries the database.
Rating System: Users can rate movies and TV shows, which is reflected on the platform.
Backend (NodeJS)
The NodeJS backend powers the database and handles data fetching, processing, and user authentication. Key features include:

API Integration: Integrated with an external API (such as OMDB or TMDB) to fetch up-to-date movie and TV show data, ensuring accurate and real-time information.
User Authentication: Implemented user registration, login, and session management using JWT tokens for secure authentication.

IMDB Clone Master website provides an interactive, responsive, and scalable platform for users to discover and rate movies and TV shows, closely mimicking the core features of the original IMDB website. The project showcases my ability to build full-stack applications, integrate third-party APIs, and implement modern authentication techniques to create a secure and engaging web experience.

This project is a perfect example of how ReactJS and NodeJS can be used together to build a fully functional and modern web application.
